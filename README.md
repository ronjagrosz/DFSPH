# DFSPH
Divergence-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics fluid simulation in the course TN1008 - Advanced simulation and visualization of fluids in computer graphics.

The project is compiled with a makefile. It will not be uploaded since the makefile differs between
the used OS.
To be able to run the project, create a folder named "frames" in the DFSPH folder.
